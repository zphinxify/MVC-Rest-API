# MVC-Rest-API

This is a MVC-Rest-API using DTO's and repositories
in order to illustrate how data can be sent within
the API without exposing the actual object being
sent. This is achieved by using DTO's. As for the DB
I'm using a SQL server. Note that the password is directly
exposed in the source code without any hashing or salt.
This is not inteded for use in a production enviroment.
